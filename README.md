# PoseNet_tracking
## INTRODUCTION

This project contains an interactive game that is controlled with three parts of the body through PoseNet. 

## THE GAME

The main objective of the game is to collect golden collectives with the nose. There will only be one collectible at a time in the screen: once you collect a collectible object, another one will appear in a random position. 
At the beginning, collectibles will be golden coins. Moreover, the shape of the next collectibles can be changed by "pressing" the pink button with any of your wrists. There are two possible shapes: a golden coin or a golden flat cube.    

## OBJECTS OF THE SCENE

You will find different objects in the main (and only) scene: 
- Blue sphere: tracks the position of the nose
- Red cube: tracks the position of the left hand
- Yello cube: tracks the position of the right hand 
- 4 white cubes: determine the limits
- Pink cilinder: button to change collectible's shape


## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

- You cannot change collectible's shape more than once in 10 seconds. 
- It is highly recommended to have both hands visibles while playing in order to avoid tracking issues.
